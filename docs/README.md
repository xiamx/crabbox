# 🦀 Crabbox Docs

**Warm a box, sync the diff, run the suite.**

## What Crabbox is

Crabbox is a shared agent workspace control plane for software maintainers and
AI agents. The goal is to keep the local developer story unchanged - edit,
save, run - while moving compute, tests, and review evidence onto owned or
provider-backed remote capacity.

A `crabbox run` command leases a brokered cloud machine, reuses a static SSH
host, or delegates to a sandbox provider, syncs your tracked and nonignored
local files, executes the command remotely, streams stdout and stderr back, and
releases or unclaims the target. Behind the scenes a small Cloudflare-hosted
broker owns cloud provider credentials, lease state, cleanup, usage, and cost
guardrails so individual machines and CLIs never need to.

## How it fits together

```text
your laptop                Cloudflare Worker            cloud provider
-------------              ------------------           --------------
crabbox CLI    -- HTTPS --> Fleet Durable Object  -->   Hetzner / AWS / Azure / GCP
   |                         lease + cost state              |
   |                                                         |
   +------------ SSH + rsync to leased runner <--------------+
```

The CLI is a Go binary. The broker is a Cloudflare Worker plus a single Durable Object. Brokered Linux runners are vanilla Ubuntu boxes prepared by cloud-init with SSH, Git, rsync, curl, jq, and `/work/crabbox`; AWS can also broker managed Windows/WSL2 and EC2 Mac desktop targets, while Azure can broker native Windows SSH/sync/run, desktop/VNC, and Windows WSL2 targets. Static hosts are existing SSH machines selected with `provider: ssh`. Project runtimes come from Actions hydration or repo-owned setup. Runners hold no broker credentials - they are leaf nodes.

## A run, end to end

1. CLI loads config from flags, env, repo, user, defaults.
2. CLI mints a per-lease SSH key and slug, then calls `POST /v1/leases` on the broker.
3. Worker checks active-lease and monthly spend caps, reserves worst-case TTL cost, provisions a server, returns host / port / user / workdir / expiry / slug.
4. CLI waits for `crabbox-ready`, seeds remote Git when possible, rsyncs the Git file-list manifest, runs sync guardrails and sanity checks, hydrates the configured base ref.
5. CLI runs the command over SSH, streams output, records run events, sends heartbeats/touches.
6. CLI releases the lease unless `--keep` is set; kept leases still auto-release after idle timeout, and the broker frees reserved cost when the lease closes.

See [How Crabbox Works](how-it-works.md) for the full picture, including warm-machine reuse and the brokered vs direct provider paths. See [Source Map](source-map.md) when you need to trace a documented behavior back to code.

## Install

```sh
brew install openclaw/tap/crabbox
```

Verify with `crabbox --version`.

## Quick start

```sh
# log in once per machine - stores a broker token in user config
crabbox login

# one-shot run on a fresh leased box
crabbox run -- pnpm test

# keep a warm box around for repeated runs; output includes an ID and slug
crabbox warmup
crabbox run --id blue-lobster -- pnpm test:changed
crabbox ssh --id blue-lobster
crabbox stop blue-lobster
```

`crabbox doctor` validates local config, network reachability, and SSH key availability before you commit to a long workflow. `crabbox usage` summarizes recent spend by user, org, provider, and server type.

## OpenClaw plugin

The repository root is also a native OpenClaw plugin package. Once installed in OpenClaw, it exposes Crabbox operations as agent tools:

- `crabbox_run`
- `crabbox_warmup`
- `crabbox_status`
- `crabbox_list`
- `crabbox_stop`

The plugin shells out to the configured `crabbox` binary with argv arrays, so local Crabbox config, broker login, repo claims, and sync behavior stay owned by the CLI. Configure `plugins.entries.crabbox.config.binary` if the binary is not on `PATH`.

Run history and inspection are intentionally handled by the Crabbox CLI and repo skill, not extra plugin tools. Use `crabbox history`, `crabbox events --after --limit`, `crabbox attach`, `crabbox logs`, `crabbox results`, and `crabbox usage` from a shell-capable agent.
