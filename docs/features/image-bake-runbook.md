# Image Bake Runbook

Read when:

- baking a new Crabbox AWS image;
- promoting or rolling back the default AWS image;
- preparing a desktop/browser image for UI QA;
- checking whether state belongs in the image or in a warm lease.

This runbook is for trusted operators. Image commands need coordinator admin
auth and can create provider-side artifacts that cost money until cleaned up.

## Naming

Use names that identify owner, purpose, and UTC bake time:

```text
crabbox-linux-desktop-browser-YYYYMMDD-HHMM
crabbox-macos-arm64-YYYYMMDD-HHMM
```

Use names that make the target and architecture obvious. A promoted macOS AMI
is scoped separately from Linux and Windows images, but the name should still be
human-auditable in the AWS console.

## What To Bake

Bake machine capabilities:

- current OS security updates;
- SSH, Git, rsync, curl, jq, and readiness helpers;
- Xvfb/slim XFCE/VNC for desktop leases;
- Chrome/Chromium for browser leases;
- `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `scrot`, `xdotool`, and other capture helpers;
- Node 22, npm, corepack, pnpm;
- build-essential, Python, and common native-addon headers;
- empty cache directories such as `/var/cache/crabbox/pnpm`.

Do not bake scenario state:

- secrets, tokens, or provider credentials;
- browser profiles, cookies, Slack/Discord/WhatsApp sessions, or OAuth state;
- source checkouts, `node_modules`, `dist`, PR artifacts, screenshots, or
  videos;
- local operator notes or one-off debugging files.

## Create A Candidate AMI

Warm a source lease:

```bash
crabbox warmup \
  --provider aws \
  --class standard \
  --desktop \
  --browser \
  --ttl 2h \
  --idle-timeout 30m
```

Capture the lease id from the output. Use the canonical `cbx_...` id for image
commands, not only the friendly slug.

Verify the source lease:

```bash
crabbox run \
  --provider aws \
  --id <cbx_id> \
  --no-sync \
  --shell -- \
  'set -euo pipefail
   command -v ssh
   command -v git
   command -v rsync
   command -v jq
   command -v node
   command -v pnpm
   command -v ffmpeg
   command -v scrot
   command -v x11vnc
   command -v google-chrome || command -v chromium || command -v chromium-browser
   test -d /work/crabbox
   sudo mkdir -p /var/cache/crabbox/pnpm
   sudo chmod 1777 /var/cache/crabbox /var/cache/crabbox/pnpm'
```

Create the candidate image:

```bash
crabbox image create \
  --id <cbx_id> \
  --name crabbox-linux-desktop-browser-YYYYMMDD-HHMM \
  --wait \
  --json
```

Keep the JSON output. At minimum, record the AMI id, name, source lease id,
creation time, and operator.

## Smoke Candidate Before Promotion

Boot the candidate explicitly. Use the provider image override supported by the
current environment, for example:

```bash
CRABBOX_AWS_AMI=ami-1234567890abcdef0 \
crabbox warmup \
  --provider aws \
  --class standard \
  --desktop \
  --browser \
  --ttl 30m \
  --idle-timeout 10m
```

Run a smoke on the candidate:

```bash
crabbox run \
  --provider aws \
  --id <candidate-cbx_id-or-slug> \
  --no-sync \
  --shell -- \
  'set -euo pipefail
   echo image-smoke-ok
   uname -srm
   command -v node
   command -v pnpm
   command -v ffmpeg
   command -v scrot
   command -v google-chrome || command -v chromium || command -v chromium-browser
   test -d /work/crabbox'
```

For desktop/browser images, also run a real desktop/browser proof:

```bash
crabbox screenshot --provider aws --id <candidate-cbx_id-or-slug> --output /tmp/crabbox-image-smoke.png
```

Do not promote if SSH readiness, browser startup, screenshot capture, or the
package/tool checks fail.

## Promote

Promote only after a candidate smoke passes:

```bash
crabbox image promote ami-1234567890abcdef0 --json
```

Then verify a normal brokered lease without overrides uses the promoted image:

```bash
crabbox warmup \
  --provider aws \
  --class standard \
  --desktop \
  --browser \
  --ttl 30m \
  --idle-timeout 10m

crabbox run \
  --provider aws \
  --id <new-cbx_id-or-slug> \
  --no-sync \
  --shell -- \
  'echo promoted-image-smoke-ok && command -v ffmpeg && command -v node'
```

Keep the previous promoted AMI available until at least one normal brokered
lease and one relevant QA lane pass on the new image.

## macOS Images

macOS images use the same `image create` command, but the source lease must be
an AWS EC2 Mac lease on an allocated Dedicated Host:

```bash
crabbox admin mac-hosts offerings --region eu-west-1 --type mac2.metal
crabbox admin mac-hosts list --region eu-west-1
```

If no suitable host is available, allocate one explicitly before warmup:

```bash
crabbox admin mac-hosts allocate \
  --region eu-west-1 \
  --type mac2.metal \
  --dry-run
```

If dry-run reports `UnauthorizedOperation`, update the coordinator AWS identity
with the EC2 Mac host lifecycle policy in [admin](../commands/admin.md#mac-hosts)
before doing the real allocation.

For an end-to-end guarded run, use the repository smoke script:

```bash
scripts/macos-image-lifecycle-smoke.sh
```

By default it only runs host offering/list/dry-run checks and stops before paid
allocation or lease creation. The dry-run is parsed from the command's JSON
output so the script only continues when at least one availability zone reports
`ok: true`. After the dry-run succeeds, opt in to the paid lifecycle
explicitly:

```bash
CRABBOX_MACOS_ALLOCATE=1 \
CRABBOX_MACOS_PROMOTE=1 \
scripts/macos-image-lifecycle-smoke.sh
```

The script warms a macOS desktop lease, verifies SSH/sync/VNC prerequisites,
starts WebVNC, waits for the portal bridge to report `connected=true`, collects
desktop artifacts, creates a candidate AMI with a rebooting image capture,
boots and smokes the candidate, then promotes and smokes the promoted image
when `CRABBOX_MACOS_PROMOTE=1`. Tune the WebVNC bridge wait with
`CRABBOX_MACOS_WEBVNC_WAIT_TIMEOUT` and
`CRABBOX_MACOS_WEBVNC_WAIT_INTERVAL`; tune the post-start grace period with
`CRABBOX_MACOS_WEBVNC_START_GRACE`. EC2 Mac Dedicated Hosts have
provider-side billing and release constraints; the script stops each lease's
local WebVNC daemon before lease cleanup, waits for the host to return to
`available` between macOS boots, and releases the host only when
`CRABBOX_MACOS_RELEASE_HOST=1`. Host release is honored for source-only,
candidate-only, and promoted-image runs; the script refuses to release a
pre-existing host unless `CRABBOX_MACOS_RELEASE_EXISTING_HOST=1` is also set.
Every run writes `.crabbox/macos-image-smoke/<image-name>/summary.json` with
the current phase, host id, lease ids, AMI id when available, and artifact
paths. It also preserves host offering/list/dry-run, allocation, image create,
image promotion, host wait, warmup, and WebVNC status evidence under the run's
`evidence/` directory. Override the directory with
`CRABBOX_MACOS_ARTIFACT_DIR`.

If an available EC2 Mac Dedicated Host already exists, the script still stops
after preflight unless `CRABBOX_MACOS_RUN=1` or `CRABBOX_MACOS_ALLOCATE=1` is
set.

Stopping or terminating an EC2 Mac instance starts the AWS host scrubbing
workflow. The script waits up to `CRABBOX_MACOS_HOST_WAIT_TIMEOUT` before each
next macOS boot; the default is `5h` because Apple silicon scrubbing can take
up to 4.5 hours. Override `CRABBOX_MACOS_HOST_WAIT_INTERVAL` to change the poll
interval. If the host existed before the script started, `CRABBOX_MACOS_RELEASE_HOST=1`
will not release it unless `CRABBOX_MACOS_RELEASE_EXISTING_HOST=1` is also set.

```bash
crabbox admin mac-hosts allocate \
  --region eu-west-1 \
  --type mac2.metal \
  --force
```

```bash
crabbox warmup \
  --provider aws \
  --target macos \
  --type mac2.metal \
  --market on-demand \
  --desktop \
  --ttl 2h \
  --idle-timeout 30m
```

Verify the source lease before creating the AMI:

```bash
crabbox run \
  --provider aws \
  --target macos \
  --id <cbx_id> \
  --no-sync \
  --shell -- \
  'set -euo pipefail
   sw_vers
   command -v ssh
   command -v git
   command -v rsync
   command -v curl
   test -d "$HOME/crabbox"
   test -w "$HOME/crabbox"
   nc -z 127.0.0.1 5900'
```

Then create and promote the candidate:

```bash
crabbox image create \
  --id <cbx_id> \
  --name crabbox-macos-arm64-YYYYMMDD-HHMM \
  --wait \
  --json

crabbox image promote ami-1234567890abcdef0 --target macos --region us-east-1 --json
```

Crabbox scopes promoted AWS images by target, architecture, and region. A macOS
promotion is only selected by matching `target=macos` leases, so it will not
replace the Linux or Windows default. If you promote an AMI that was not created
through `crabbox image create`, pass both `--target macos` and `--region`.

## Roll Back

Rollback is another promotion:

```bash
crabbox image promote ami-previous-good --json
```

Run the normal brokered smoke again. Do not delete the failed AMI immediately;
keep it long enough to inspect tags, logs, and source-lease details.

## Cleanup

Promotion does not delete old AMIs or EBS snapshots. Cleanup is a provider
operator task:

- keep the current promoted AMI;
- keep the previous known-good AMI until the new one has real QA proof;
- deregister stale failed/candidate AMIs after investigation;
- delete their orphaned EBS snapshots in the AWS account.

Do not rely on Crabbox coordinator state as the source of truth for old image
storage costs. Check AWS directly.

## Hetzner Status

Hetzner image bytes belong in the Hetzner project. Crabbox can boot a configured
image through `image` or `CRABBOX_HETZNER_IMAGE`, but Hetzner image
create/promote lifecycle commands are not implemented yet. Until then, create
and manage Hetzner snapshots with Hetzner tooling, then configure Crabbox to use
the selected image.
