# AWS

Read when:

- choosing AWS as the Crabbox provider;
- debugging EC2 capacity, quotas, AMIs, security groups, or EC2 Mac hosts;
- changing AWS provisioning code in the CLI or Worker.

AWS is Crabbox's broad managed provider. It supports Linux, native Windows,
Windows WSL2, and EC2 Mac targets. Brokered mode keeps AWS credentials in the
Cloudflare Worker; direct mode uses the local AWS credential chain for provider
debugging.

## Targets

| Target | Managed | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | Yes | Spot by default; On-Demand optional; cloud-init bootstrap. |
| Windows native | Yes | EC2Launch, OpenSSH, Git for Windows, TightVNC, archive sync, first-network flyout suppression. |
| Windows WSL2 | Yes | Nested virtualization on C8i/M8i/R8i families; POSIX sync through WSL. |
| macOS | Yes | Requires an available EC2 Mac Dedicated Host; brokered mode can discover one, direct mode requires a host id. On-Demand only. |

Examples:

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider aws --class beast
crabbox run --provider aws --class beast --market on-demand -- pnpm check
crabbox warmup --provider aws --target windows --desktop
crabbox warmup --provider aws --target windows --windows-mode wsl2
crabbox warmup --provider aws --target macos --desktop --market on-demand
```

## Capacity

AWS Linux defaults to Spot. Use `--market on-demand` for one lease when Spot is
blocked or when an account only has On-Demand quota. `capacity.fallback` can
fall back to On-Demand after Spot capacity/quota failures when configured.

Set `CRABBOX_CAPACITY_REGIONS` or `capacity.regions` to give AWS more regional
headroom. Brokered and direct AWS launches try the primary region first, then
the configured capacity regions in order. The public coordinator defaults to:

```sh
CRABBOX_CAPACITY_REGIONS=eu-west-1,eu-west-2,eu-central-1,us-east-1,us-west-2
```

Prefer `standard` or `fast` during capacity incidents. `beast` starts at
48xlarge candidates and can consume 192 vCPUs per request before fallback.

Brokered AWS leases return capacity hints in the lease payload and CLI output.
Hints include the selected region/market, failed attempt regions, quota
pressure, Spot-to-On-Demand fallback, and high-pressure class warnings. Set
`capacity.hints: false` or `CRABBOX_CAPACITY_HINTS=0` to suppress them. Set
`CRABBOX_CAPACITY_LARGE_CLASSES=beast,large` when an installation wants warning
hints for a different set of classes.

These fields are wire-compatible with mixed CLI/broker versions. Upgraded
brokers add optional response fields that older clients ignore. Upgraded
clients keep the lease request sparse: they omit default hint and routing fields
and do not send the capacity block at all for broker defaults, unless an
operator configures a non-default market/strategy/fallback, a multi-region pool,
pinned availability zones, or `capacity.hints: false`.

Crabbox tries ordered instance candidates for the requested class. Explicit
`--type` is exact: if EC2 rejects it, Crabbox fails clearly instead of silently
choosing another type.

Current class defaults:

```text
AWS Linux
standard  c7a.8xlarge, c7i.8xlarge, m7a.8xlarge, m7i.8xlarge, c7a.4xlarge
fast      c7a.16xlarge, c7i.16xlarge, m7a.16xlarge, m7i.16xlarge, c7a.12xlarge, c7a.8xlarge
large     c7a.24xlarge, c7i.24xlarge, m7a.24xlarge, m7i.24xlarge, r7a.24xlarge, c7a.16xlarge, c7a.12xlarge
beast     c7a.48xlarge, c7i.48xlarge, m7a.48xlarge, m7i.48xlarge, r7a.48xlarge, c7a.32xlarge, c7i.32xlarge, m7a.32xlarge, c7a.24xlarge, c7a.16xlarge

AWS Windows
standard  m7i.large, m7a.large, t3.large
fast      m7i.xlarge, m7a.xlarge, t3.xlarge
large     m7i.2xlarge, m7a.2xlarge, t3.2xlarge
beast     m7i.4xlarge, m7a.4xlarge, m7i.2xlarge

AWS Windows WSL2
standard  m8i.large, m8i-flex.large, c8i.large, r8i.large
fast      m8i.xlarge, m8i-flex.xlarge, c8i.xlarge, r8i.xlarge
large     m8i.2xlarge, m8i-flex.2xlarge, c8i.2xlarge, r8i.2xlarge
beast     m8i.4xlarge, m8i-flex.4xlarge, c8i.4xlarge, r8i.4xlarge, m8i.2xlarge

AWS macOS
all       mac2.metal, then mac1.metal unless `--type` is set
```

Exact AWS Windows WSL2 `--type` values must come from nested-virtualization
families. Crabbox rejects unsupported families such as M7 or T3 before it asks
AWS/coordinator for a lease; omit `--type` to let class fallback choose.

## Broker Secrets And Env

Worker secrets:

```text
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN optional
CRABBOX_AWS_MAC_HOST_ID optional; pins a brokered EC2 Mac Dedicated Host
```

EC2 Mac host lifecycle is explicit operator work:

```sh
crabbox admin mac-hosts policy
crabbox admin aws-identity --region eu-west-1
crabbox admin aws-policy --mac-hosts
crabbox admin mac-hosts list --region eu-west-1
crabbox admin mac-hosts offerings --region eu-west-1 --type mac2.metal
crabbox admin mac-hosts allocate --region eu-west-1 --type mac2.metal --dry-run
crabbox admin mac-hosts allocate --region eu-west-1 --type mac2.metal --force
crabbox admin mac-hosts release h-0123456789abcdef0 --region eu-west-1 --force
```

The coordinator AWS identity needs `ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings`,
`ec2:DescribeHosts`, `ec2:AllocateHosts`, `ec2:ReleaseHosts`, and
`ec2:CreateTags` for these admin commands. The `CreateTags` grant is needed
because Crabbox tags hosts during `AllocateHosts`; scope it with
`ec2:CreateAction=AllocateHosts`. Use `allocate --dry-run` first; it validates
the request path without creating a Dedicated Host. Use `admin aws-identity` to
confirm which coordinator AWS principal needs the policy.

That host lifecycle policy is not the full macOS image policy. The later
warmup, WebVNC, AMI create, candidate boot, promotion, and cleanup phases also
need the normal brokered AWS provider permissions documented in
[Infrastructure](../infrastructure.md#aws-ec2), including launch/list/tag/terminate,
key pair, security group, image, snapshot, and optional Service Quotas access.
Print the combined provider plus Dedicated Host policy with
`crabbox admin aws-policy --mac-hosts`, or print the two grants separately with
`crabbox admin aws-policy` and `crabbox admin mac-hosts policy`.

CLI/direct env and config:

```text
AWS_PROFILE
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
CRABBOX_AWS_REGION
CRABBOX_AWS_AMI
CRABBOX_AWS_SECURITY_GROUP_ID
CRABBOX_AWS_SUBNET_ID
CRABBOX_AWS_INSTANCE_PROFILE
CRABBOX_AWS_ROOT_GB
CRABBOX_AWS_SSH_CIDRS
CRABBOX_AWS_MAC_HOST_ID
CRABBOX_CAPACITY_REGIONS
CRABBOX_CAPACITY_AVAILABILITY_ZONES
CRABBOX_CAPACITY_HINTS
CRABBOX_CAPACITY_LARGE_CLASSES
```

## Security And Networking

Crabbox imports or reuses an EC2 key pair, creates or reuses the
`crabbox-runners` security group when no security group is supplied, and opens
only SSH ports to configured CIDRs or the detected request source. VNC stays
behind the SSH tunnel. Supplying `CRABBOX_AWS_SECURITY_GROUP_ID` makes ingress
policy your responsibility.

## Images

Linux resolves the latest Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 AMI unless overridden. Windows
resolves the latest Windows Server 2022 English Full Base AMI unless overridden.
Operators can create and promote trusted AWS images with `crabbox image`.
