# Providers

Read when:

- changing Hetzner, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Proxmox, or Blacksmith Testbox provisioning;
- adding a backend;
- adjusting machine classes, fallback order, regions, or images.

Crabbox currently supports four brokered providers:

```text
hetzner     Hetzner Cloud servers
aws         AWS EC2 instances
azure       Azure Virtual Machines
gcp         Google Cloud Compute Engine instances
```

Brokered Hetzner leases are Linux targets. Brokered AWS supports Linux, native
Windows Server, Windows WSL2, and EC2 Mac when a Dedicated Host is configured.
Brokered Azure supports Linux, native Windows, and Windows WSL2 SSH/sync/run.
Brokered GCP supports Linux SSH/sync/run. Static SSH still
exists for reusing existing macOS and Windows machines:

```text
ssh         Existing SSH host selected by static.host
```

Direct provider backends can also run without the Crabbox coordinator:

```text
proxmox    Proxmox VE QEMU VM clones exposed as SSH leases
semaphore  Semaphore CI jobs exposed as SSH leases
namespace  Namespace Devboxes exposed as SSH leases
sprites    Sprites microVMs exposed as SSH leases through sprite proxy
daytona    Daytona sandboxes with SDK/toolbox run and short-lived SSH access
islo       Islo sandboxes with delegated command execution
e2b        E2B sandboxes with delegated command execution
modal      Modal Sandboxes with delegated command execution
tensorlake Tensorlake Firecracker sandboxes with delegated command execution
```

## Hetzner Summary

- imports or reuses the lease SSH key;
- creates a server with Crabbox labels;
- uses configured image and location;
- falls back across class server types when capacity or quota rejects a request;
- fetches server-type hourly prices when cost estimates need provider pricing.

## AWS Summary

- signs EC2 Query API calls inside the Worker;
- imports or reuses an EC2 key pair;
- creates or reuses the `crabbox-runners` security group with SSH ingress limited to configured CIDRs or the request source IP;
- launches one-time Linux Spot or On-Demand instances;
- launches AWS Windows Server leases with EC2Launch PowerShell user data, then a
  post-SSH Crabbox bootstrap for OpenSSH/Git/user setup; `--desktop` adds
  TightVNC, auto-logon, and first-network flyout suppression;
- launches EC2 Mac leases only with an explicit Dedicated Host id
  (`CRABBOX_AWS_MAC_HOST_ID` or `aws.macHostId`) and On-Demand capacity;
- tags instances, volumes, and Spot requests;
- falls back across broad C/M/R instance families for class requests, including account policy and capacity rejections;
- can fall back to a small burstable type when account policy rejects the high-core class candidates;
- preflights applied Spot or On-Demand vCPU quotas in brokered mode when Service Quotas allows it, then records skipped candidates as quota attempts;
- supports `--market spot|on-demand` on `warmup` and `run` for one-off capacity-market overrides;
- uses Spot placement score across configured regions in direct AWS mode;
- can fall back to On-Demand after Spot capacity/quota failures when configured;
- fetches Spot price history when cost estimates need provider pricing.

Explicit `--type` requests are treated as exact provider type requests. If that type is rejected, Crabbox fails clearly instead of silently choosing a different instance type. Remove `--type` and use a machine class when fallback is desired.

`crabbox list` marks brokered provider machines as `orphan=no-active-lease`
when their provider label references a lease that is no longer active in the
coordinator. This is an operator hint only; `keep=true` machines are not
deleted automatically.

Direct provider mode still exists when no coordinator is configured. It uses local AWS credentials, Azure credentials, Google Application Default Credentials, Proxmox API tokens, or `HCLOUD_TOKEN`/`HETZNER_TOKEN` and should stay secondary to the brokered path when a brokered provider is available.

Tailscale is not a provider. Use `--tailscale` to add tailnet reachability to
new managed Linux leases, or set a static host to a MagicDNS name/100.x address
when the existing host is already on a tailnet. See [Tailscale](tailscale.md).

Direct smoke shape:

```sh
tmp="$(mktemp)"
printf 'provider: hetzner\n' > "$tmp"
CRABBOX_CONFIG="$tmp" CRABBOX_COORDINATOR= crabbox warmup --provider hetzner --class standard --ttl 15m --idle-timeout 4m
CRABBOX_CONFIG="$tmp" CRABBOX_COORDINATOR= crabbox run --provider hetzner --id <slug> --no-sync -- echo direct-hetzner-ok
CRABBOX_CONFIG="$tmp" CRABBOX_COORDINATOR= crabbox stop --provider hetzner <slug>
rm -f "$tmp"
```

Use `--provider aws` with AWS SDK credentials for direct AWS smoke, or
`--provider gcp` with Google Application Default Credentials for direct GCP
smoke. The direct GCP path uses Google's Compute Go SDK and project-wide
aggregated instance listing for resolve, list, and cleanup. Direct mode
has no Durable Object alarm; cleanup is best-effort through provider labels and
manual `crabbox cleanup`. Direct AWS fallback can retry provider types, but the
structured quota preflight and `provisioningAttempts` metadata belong to the
brokered Worker path.

Use `--provider proxmox` with `CRABBOX_PROXMOX_*` config for direct Proxmox
smoke. Proxmox clones a configured Linux QEMU template, injects SSH via
cloud-init, discovers the IP and bootstraps the VM through the QEMU guest agent,
then uses normal Crabbox SSH sync/run/release.

Crabbox can also wrap Blacksmith Testboxes with `provider: blacksmith-testbox`. That backend does not use the Crabbox broker or direct cloud credentials. It shells out to the authenticated Blacksmith CLI for `testbox warmup`, `run`, `status`, `list`, and `stop`, while Crabbox keeps local slugs, repo claims, config, and timing summaries. See [Blacksmith Testbox](blacksmith-testbox.md).

Crabbox can use Namespace Devboxes with `provider: namespace-devbox`. Namespace
owns Devbox auth and lifecycle through the `devbox` CLI, while Crabbox treats
the prepared Devbox as a normal Linux SSH lease and owns rsync, run, status,
and timing. See [Namespace Devbox](namespace-devbox.md).

Crabbox can use Semaphore CI jobs with `provider: semaphore`. Semaphore is an
SSH lease backend: the provider creates a standalone Semaphore job, waits until
the job exposes host/port metadata and a debug SSH key, then Crabbox performs
normal SSH sync and command execution. Use it when the test should run in the
same machine image, project secret context, and cache plane as Semaphore CI. It
does not use the Crabbox coordinator. See [Semaphore](semaphore.md).

Crabbox can use Sprites microVMs with `provider: sprites`. Sprites is an SSH
lease backend: Crabbox creates a sprite, installs OpenSSH and rsync inside it,
then reaches SSH through `sprite proxy`. Use it when you want a fast Linux
microVM while keeping Crabbox's standard SSH sync/run path and `crabbox ssh`.
It does not use the Crabbox coordinator. See [Sprites](sprites.md).

Crabbox can use Daytona sandboxes with `provider: daytona`. Crabbox creates a
sandbox from `daytona.snapshot`, syncs and executes `run` through Daytona's
SDK/toolbox APIs, and mints short-lived SSH tokens only for explicit `ssh`
access. See [Daytona](daytona.md).

Crabbox can use Islo sandboxes with `provider: islo`. Islo is a delegated run
backend: the Islo Go SDK owns sandbox lifecycle and Crabbox streams command
output from Islo's exec SSE endpoint. See [Islo](islo.md).

Crabbox can use E2B sandboxes with `provider: e2b`. E2B is a delegated run
backend: Crabbox creates E2B sandboxes, syncs a gzipped archive through the
sandbox file API, and streams command output from E2B's process API. See
[E2B](e2b.md).

Crabbox can use Modal Sandboxes with `provider: modal`. Modal is a delegated run
backend: Crabbox creates Modal Sandboxes through the local Python client, syncs a
gzipped archive through Sandbox exec, and streams command output from Modal's
process API. See [Modal](../providers/modal.md).

Static SSH targets:

```yaml
provider: ssh
target: macos
static:
  host: mac-studio.local
  user: steipete
  port: "22"
  workRoot: /Users/steipete/crabbox
```

```yaml
provider: ssh
target: windows
windows:
  mode: normal
static:
  host: win-dev.local
  user: Peter
  port: "22"
  workRoot: C:\crabbox
```

`target: windows` supports `windows.mode: normal` and `windows.mode: wsl2`.
Normal mode uses PowerShell over OpenSSH and syncs the manifest as a tar archive.
WSL2 mode requires AWS nested virtualization, so managed AWS WSL2 leases use
C8i, M8i, or R8i families and enable nested virtualization at launch. Static
WSL2 hosts keep the POSIX SSH contract: commands run through
`wsl.exe --exec bash -lc`, rsync uses `wsl.exe rsync`, and `static.workRoot`
should be a WSL path such as `/home/peter/crabbox`. macOS also uses the POSIX
contract and needs `git`, `rsync`, `tar`, and SSH.
